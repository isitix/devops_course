# Devops_course

This course is a devops course for engineers with many hands-on labs. It's organized as an height days track:

- Days 1 and 2: system configuration with ansible
- Days 3 and 4: infrastructure management with openstack
- Days 5 and 6: Container orchestration : docker, mesos, rancher/kubernetes
- Days 7 and 8: continuous delivery of a scalable architecture with Gitlab CI

## Objectives of the course

We'll try to give you big pictures, opinionated hints on dos and don'ts, and hands-on real-life, state of (our) art, often quick and dirty and hopefully useful examples. As far as possible, we'll keep on track, we'll promulgate best practices rather than bad ones and we'll avoid anti-patterns.
